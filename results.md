## Directly observable variables: 

- A, arrived clients count (arrival count): 13
- C, clients serviced count (completed count): 13
- B, active time in service point (busy time): 375.28
- T, total simulation time (time): 321.22
## Derived variables (from the previous variables) are:

- U, service point utilization related to the max capacity, U = B/T: 1.17
- X, service throughput, number of clients serviced related to the time, X = C/T: 0.04
- S, service time, average service time in the service point, S = B/C: 28.87
## Additional directly observable variables are:

- W, waiting time, cumulative response times sum of all clients: 532.75
## From these last two, we can further derive the following quantities:

- R, response time, average throughput time at the service point, R = W/C: 40.98
- N, average queue length at the service point (including the served) N = W/T: 1.66
